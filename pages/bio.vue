				Hey there! My name is Ryan. I'm a part time programmer, quarter time web developer, part time engineer and full time fuckin weirdo.
			</p>
			<p class="text-left">
				I started my education in network administration. Learning the ins and outs of how enterprise networks function and mange their resources as well as their people.
				I learned how to use basic server software as well as enterprise networking appliances such as Cisco Routers, Switches and Firewalls. As well as fundamental data security and forensics.
				However, I wasn't satisfied with my understanding of technology. I knew how to use fancy computers, but not how humans tricked some rocks into doing math and making the pretty pictures.
				I then decided to start my education in computer science, where I learned the foundations of computer programming in Java, but also branching out into Assembly and C#, Perl, and Python.
			</p>
			<p class="text-left">
				Around this time, I decided I wanted to do something with my life that maybe I could get a few stories from. In 2016 I enlisted in the National Guard as a Combat Engineer.
				Didn't really get a lot of relevant experience here for my civilian Job, but now I know how to blow shit up and drive big trucks. So that's cool I guess.
