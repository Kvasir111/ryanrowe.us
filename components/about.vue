      My name is Ryan! <br>
      Now, you're probably hoping this section will contain some sort of useful title like "Hello my name is Ryan Rowe,
      I am a Java Engineer" or "Hello, yes, I am a .NET developer", however, those one line titles don't really do a
      great job at giving anyone an accurate picture of who somebody is. Instead I'm hoping this little ramble will give
      you
      an overview of what I've done, what my interests are, and what I hope the future holds for me!

    <h1 class="text-xl">My Story</h1>
    <p>
      When I left high school and stepped out from the borders of safety of mandatory education, I had absolutely no
      idea what I wanted to do with my life. I knew I liked technology, and messing around on computers was fun, but
      what actual application that passion and aptitude had professionally, did not actually click with me. In my
      indecision, I decided to at least start my education with a technical skill, something concrete that I could say
      “I did”, so I went and got a degree at my local technical college. After two years, I graduated, and realized that
      I had more than just a passing shine for technology and computers and decided to pursue even more education. I
      then went and got myself a cool four-year degree at a state college and just kind of hoped that I would find where
      I belonged when I got done there.
      Much to nobody’s surprise but my own, I didn’t find my place. What my education gave me was a large pool of
      information, but no actual expertise or practical experience in one area. Which, I guess is the point of higher
      education. It really upsets me when people say that higher education did nothing for them when so many jobs, the
      things we do day in day out so we can feed ourselves, just straight up require a form of college now to even get
      in the lobby, but I do understand why that sentiment exists now. I know how to code, I know how a computer works,
      I know how computers talk to each other. I have a nice bird’s eye view of the landscape of computer science, but
      the actual texture of the ground is still out of my reach. A degree is just your ticket to ride the air balloon
      over the peaks and valleys of the fields of science, your passion for one area is where you say goodbye to
      academia and take a leap of faith out of the balloon, onto the harsh unforgiving earth below. <br>
      All of that long winded, flowery metaphor is to say, is that over six years of higher education, multiple jobs,
      arguments with professors, and lectern thumping class speeches, I still have not found my place. And I have
      settled on that being OK. The fatalism of predestination isn’t what I want, and just because you didn’t find your
      slot in the great wheel of humanity right away, doesn’t mean you’re a failure.
