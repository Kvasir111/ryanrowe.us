# What the heck is this?

this is the public repo for my website

# but y?

because I find that having these public to me is incredibly convenient and allows me to easily go back and refactor old
code

# Isn't this like the 12th version of your site?

It is , please stop mentioning it.

# Why don't you use something like wordpress?

Because wordpress is for cowards and I basically use my own site as a test tube for new technologies
